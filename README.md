# Hydroponics-System
An integrated hydroponics system with AI-enabled growth monitoring, disease detection, and optimized lighting, catering to vertical cultivation using h1 hybrid seeds and sensors for precise nutrient and pH control, offering advanced disease identification and future growth projection for enhanced crop management.
WORKING
The smart irrigation system utilizes advanced technology to optimize water usage and ensure crop health. It incorporates a NodeMCU microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, DHT22 for environmental monitoring, relay, submersible pump, and pH sensor. Additionally, AI is employed for disease detection through image analysis. The system monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity to determine watering needs, adjusts pH levels for optimal nutrient uptake, and detects diseases early to prevent crop damage. Overall, it revolutionizes traditional farming practices by promoting efficient water usage, monitoring environmental conditions, and enhancing crop health through advanced technology.
APPLICATIONS
Its applications span across Smart Agriculture, enabling farmers to optimize resource utilization and enhance crop yield, to Urban Farming, facilitating efficient vertical cultivation in limited spaces, and to Data-Driven Agriculture, contributing to higher resource efficiency through precision cultivation techniques.
